    <h1> What is बिहुं ? </h1>

    <p> The main food of the Bodo people is rice. Different kinds of paddy rice like aahu, Sali, joha,
        bora, aaijong, ranjit etc. are cultivated by them and used to eatusually three times in a day. Khar,the so
        called assamese word for a liquid food is one of the favourite foods of the Bodos. It is produced by burning
        the arid bark and root of banana tree.They basically love to collect leaf vegetables like curry leaf, skunk
        vine,
        fern, water spanish and arum so as to add those to their favourite food lists. Besides being eating those
        collecting direct from nature (as they live in such a naturally rich land in India) the Bodo people also prefer
        to eat meat. Even they have been developing a tradition of rearing poultry, piggery, fishing for their own
        consumption as food. They prepare local rice wine and drink it as traditional food. Various types of mash
        racipies, a well known food of Assam are also prefered by the Bodos.
